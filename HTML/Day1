                                                         …
                                                                            …

                                                                            …

                                                                       </head>

           2.) The body part is return within      

                                                                       <body>

                                                                           …

                                                                           …

                                                                      </body>

             In head tag we define title of the page.

             In body tag we define the body of the page.

1.     For heading tag:

        Inside the body we can place different elements. The tags <h1> to <h6> are use for heading of different size.

        H tags only use for one-line words

                  <h1> is the biggest size tag.

                  <h6> is the smallest size tag.

                                  Example: <h1> Welcome to HTML</h1>

                                  Same as all remaining tags h2,h3,h4,h5,h6 but the font size is different.

2.     For image tag:

        In this tag if we want to place the image inside the webpage we use this tag. And also we need to give the height and width.

                       Example:

                                      <imp src=” pathname” alt=”imagename” height=”300px” width=”300px”>

                                                                    or

                                      <imp src=” pathname” alt=”imagename” height=”100%” width=”100%>

       User interest if user want px or %

       We can put height=”100%” width=”100%” (pathname mean the location of the image in your system before giving pathname

        you have to download the image in your system)

3.      For paragraph:

    Is tag is use for paragraph. In webpage we want to place the paragraph we use this tag.

                         Example: <p> paragraph here </p>

4.     For next line:

    This tag is use for next line. In paragraph we need to start in new line we use this.  

                         Example: <p> the dog is eating <br> the dog is running</p>      

                                         Output: the dog is eating

                                                       the dog is running
