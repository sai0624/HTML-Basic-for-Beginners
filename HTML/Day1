         A html consists of two parts. Those are
            1)Head part            2) Body part
           1.) The head part is return within         <head>
                                                         …
                                                         …
                                                         …
                                                      </head>
           2.) The body part is return within         <body>
                                                        …
                                                        …
                                                     </body>
             In head tag we define title of the page.
             In body tag we define the body of the page.
         1.) For heading tag:
                  Inside the body we can place different elements. The tags <h1> to <h6> are use for heading of different size. 
                  H tags only use for one-line words
                  <h1> is the biggest size tag.
                  <h6> is the smallest size tag.
                                  Example: <h1> Welcome to HTML</h1>
                                  Same as all remaining tags h2,h3,h4,h5,h6 but the font size is different.
         2.) For image tag:
                  In this tag if we want to place the image inside the webpage we use this tag. And also we need to give the height and width.
                                  Example:
                                        <imp src=” pathname” alt=”imagename” height=”300px” width=”300px”>
                                                                    or
                                        <imp src=” pathname” alt=”imagename” height=”100%” width=”100%>
                                        User interest if user want px or %
                 We can put height=”100%” width=”100%” (pathname mean the location of the image in your system before giving pathname 
                 you have to download the image in your system)
         3.) For paragraph:
                 Is tag is use for paragraph. In webpage we want to place the paragraph we use this tag.
                 Better use "pre"
                                 Example: <pre> paragraph here </pre>
         4.) For next line:
                 This tag is use for next line. In paragraph we need to start in new line we use this.              
                                  Example: <pre> the dog is eating <br> the dog is running</pre>      
                                                 Output: the dog is eating
                                                         the dog is running
         5.) For anchor tag (a href tag):
                The HTML code used to create a link to another page.
                The HREF is an attribute of the anchor tag, which is also used to identify sections within a document
                                  Example: <a href="website link"> click here to go the new website </a>
         6.) For iframe tag:
                The <iframe> tag specifies an inline frame. 
                An inline frame is used to embed another document within the current HTML document.
